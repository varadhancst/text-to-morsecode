# text-to-morsecode

I developed a Morse code converter using Python and Flask. The program allows users to input a message in text form and receive the corresponding Morse code translation. The conversion is done on the server-side using Flask, and the result is displayed on the client-side using HTML and JavaScript. The program also includes error handling for invalid input and a feature to clear the input and output fields. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a full-stack web application using modern technologies and good coding practices.
